# ansible-inclusion
Requests to include new collections into the `ansible` package.

We use GitHub's Discussion feature to track these requests.

All new collections submitted for inclusion MUST satisfy the [Collection Requirements](https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst).
If there are any questions, feel free to ask for clarifications in the discussion described below and / or in the `#ansible-community` IRC channel.

1. Start a GitHub Discussion in the [new collection review category](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/new?category=new-collection-reviews).  Please copy the following into your initial message:
```
Two or three sentence description of your collection

Ansible Galaxy: https://galaxy.ansible.com/NAMESPACE/COLLECTION
GitHub: https://github.com/ORG/REPONAME
Issues Tracker: https://github.com/ORG/REPONAME/issues
GitHub Handles: 
Is the collection part of Automation Hub: Yes/Soon/No
We meet [Collection Requirements](https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst): Yes/No
```
In case the repository is not on GitHub, please provide email addresses.

2. Ensure any other maintainers of the collection are `@mentioned` in the discussion so they will receive update.
3. Promptly reply to any questions.
